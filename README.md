# Web Accessibility Fundamentals

_The web is awesome and everyone should be able to enjoy it._

---

Hi there! I'm [Sandrina Pereira](https://www.sandrina-p.net/) and I believe that making the web accessible is one of our duties as web developers.

These are the material resources for my [Web Accessibility Fundamentals Workshop](https://www.sandrina-p.net/workshop-a11y-fundamentals/).

## Pre-Workshop requirements

To get the most out of the workshop, please do the following things in advance:

- **Install [Zoom](https://zoom.us)** to join the video call.
  - Turn on your video if possible, so we don't feel alone.
  - Keep your microphone muted to avoid background noises.
- **Install a modern browser**. Chrome or Firefox are recommended.
- **Familiarize yourself with the basics of a screen reader**. During a remote workshop it's not practical to help everyone using a SR (screen reader). For that reason, please take some minutes to practice in advance.
  - Mac: You'll be using VoiceOver. [Watch this VO introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R-6WvAihms&t=198s).
  - Windows: Install [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) and [watch this NVDA introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jao3s_CwdRU).
  - Linux: Install [Orca](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca) and [watch this Orca introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OWSztc3AtY).
  - SR keyboard shortcuts: [VO and NVDA](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/survival-guide) and [Orca](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/commands_controlling_orca.html.en).

The better prepared you are for the workshop, the more you will learn from it!

## Setup the workshop

### Recommended

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) before proceding. Otherwise jump to the next _Alternatives_ section.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sandrina-p/workshop-a11y-fundamentals.git

# Go to workshop folder
cd a11y-fundamentals

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Run the project
npm start
```

### Alternatives

#### A: Locally

Just [download the project](https://github.com/sandrina-p/workshop-a11y-fundamentals/archive/master.zip), open `src/index.html` and you are ready to go.

#### B: In the browser

You may go through the [workshop on Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/sandrina-p/a11y-fundamentals?initialpath=/src/index.html). Open the link and fork the project. Make sure to open each individual exercise page in a new window so that you can use DevTools more easily.

### Project structure

```bash
src
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ briefings     # Exercise instructions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exercises     # Where you'll be working
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ xx.html     # The exercise html
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ xx.css      # The exercise styles
|-- solutions     # The final solutions
|-- index.html    # Workshop entry point
```

- In each exercise, you'll find the lucky clover emoji üçÄ to guide you. I don't expecte you to complete all the exercises on time. The goal is to introduce you to new things, and **make you think about it, and ask me questions** as we go through the content.
- Learning Tip: **Check the solutions only as a last resource.** If you take a peek at the solution before even trying, you'll be sabotaging your own learning. It's okay to struggle while you solve the exercise. It's part of the learning process. :)
