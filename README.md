# Web Accessibility Essentials

_The web is awesome and everyone should be able to enjoy it._

---

These are the material resources for my [Web Accessibility Fundamentals Workshop](https://www.sandrina-p.net/workshop-a11y-fundamentals/).

---

Hi there! I'm [Sandrina Pereira](https://www.sandrina-p.net/) and I belive that making the web accessible is one of our duties as web developers.

## Pre-Workshop requirements

To get the most out of the workshop, please do the following things in advance:

- Install [Zoom](https://zoom.us) to join the video call.
  - Turn on your video if possible, so we don't feel alone.
  - Keep your microphone muted to avoid background noises.
- Install a modern browser: Chrome or Firefox are recommended.
- Familiarize yourself with the basics of a screen reader. During a remote workshop it's not practical to help everyone using a screen reader (SR), so please take some minutes to practice. Once you are able to navigate through this page using a screen reader, consider yourself ready to go!

  - Mac: You'll be using VoiceOver. [Watch this VO introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R-6WvAihms&t=198s)
  - Windows: Install [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) and [watch this NVDA introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jao3s_CwdRU).
  - Linux: Install [Orca](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca) and [watch this Orca introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OWSztc3AtY)

  - SR keyboard shortcuts: [VO and NVDA](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/survival-guide) and [Orca](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/commands_controlling_orca.html.en)

The better prepared you are for the workshop, the more you will learn from it!
