# 1.3. Meaningful images

## Introduction

_"One image is worth a thousand words"_, they say.

Images helps us to better understand some content, they are especially useful for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.

However, inaccessible image can create major barriers for people with visual disabilities. Creating accessible images will benefit not only them, but also the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of a website.

You probably know that every `<img>` should have an `alt` attribute, but it doesn't need to be used equally everywhere.
The same way there are [multiple images concepts]((https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images), we can also describe them in different ways.
For example, if the image doesn't add any relevant information about the content, we can just leave an empty alt: `alt=""`.

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/1.3.html),
there are 4 visual representations, but none of them are accessible.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Add the necessary accessible descriptions to each image.

**Tip 1: Alt text** - Replace the image `src` with an invalid URL and see how the browser renders a broken image. Does the alt text makes sense?

### Bonus

In slow internet connections, the images takes time to load. Some people even prefer to disable images to save bandwidth data.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Edit the CSS to ensure the page looks good when images don't load.

**Tip:** In your daily job, take this as an opportunity to for developers and designers to collaborate!
