# 1.1 Appearance

## Introduction

Accessibility (A11Y) is more than making information available to people.

Any person should perceive content with ease. For that, we should respect people's disabilities and preferences.
Let's start with the two most common appearance topics: _color_ and _proportions_.

### Color

Color contrast is the [biggest A11Y issue](https://webaim.org/projects/million/#wcag), yet one of the easiest to fix, by following the [WCAG color contrast guidelines](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/). Here's some of my favorite free tools:

- [WebAIM contract checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- [Colour Contract](https://colourcontrast.cc/) - Chrome extension
- [Stark](https://www.getstark.co/) - Figma plugin

### Proportions (size)

It's out of our control to know the exact size or font that will be presented to people because a webpage can be consumed in multiple mediums.

For that reason, it's safer to **think about _proportions_ insted of _sizes_ when building interfaces**. This can be achieved by using relative units instead of absolute units for text size.

The relative units `rem` and `em` are the best replacements for `px`. An `em` is an unit of typography, relative to the `font-size` of its nearest parent. A `rem` is only relative to the html (root) `font-size`.

The default `font-size` in almost every browser is `16px`. Assuming that, we can say that **`1rem = 16px`**.

```css
.title {
  font-size: 1.5rem; /* same as 24px (24/16 or 16*1.5) */
}
```

**Math simplified:** The math `x/16` can be painful when dealing with certain numbers. (eg 15px equals 0.9375rem). We can simplify that by setting the root size to 62.5%, which means `1rem` equals `10px`.

```css
html {
  /* 62.5% of 16px is 10px.  */
  font-size: 62.5%;
}

body {
  font-size: 1.6rem; /* 16px */
}

.heading-1 {
  /* font-size: 28px; */ /* -- old way */
  font-size: 2.8rem; /* ------ new way */
}
```

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/1.1.html), there are multiple accessibility problems related with color and proportions:

- Color: Some text has not enough color contrast.
- Size: The text size is written with absolute units.

**üéØ Goal:** Make the page follow appearance guidelines that respect level AA.

- **Hint 1:** Use an [A11Y extension](#extensions) to help you detect color contrast issues.
- **Hint 2:** Use the Chrome DevTools color picker to find a color that respects level AA.
- **Hint 3:** Customize your browser font size to see how the content is displayed as you update the code from absolute to relative units. Go to _Settings > Appearance > Font Size_. (Chrome and Firefox)

## Bonus - Achieving level AAA

### 1. Color: Theming

When creating multiple themes, we can use the CSS media query [`prefers-color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) to set the default theme based on the user color preferences.

**üéØ Goal:** Add a `dark` theme to the page. Here are its colors:

```css
--bg_0: #383838;
--bg_1: #2e2a2f;
--text_0: #f8f3ef;
```

**üçÄ Tip:** In Chrome, you can change rendering preferences. In Dev Tools, go to Settings > Rendering. Scroll down until "Emulate CSS media" and select the preferred scheme.

### 2. Motion preference

We tend to use motion techniques as a way to communicate information. However, some people find them distracting or uncomfortable. Others can't even see the animations, particularly people with cognitive disabilities or slow devices.

In spite of the growing desire to create an immersive experience, remember that **animations are an enhancement** and should not be a barrier to understand the content.

The CSS media query `preferes-reduced-motion` allows us to respect the user's motion preferences.

```css
.error {
  animation: shake 400ms;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .error {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```

**üéØ Goal:** Remove the notification bell animation

**üçÄ Tip:** This is also available in Chrome "Rendering" panel.

### 3. Visual presentation

There are a few small tweaks we can still do, following the WCGAG recommendations for blocks of text, such as:

- Width is no more than 80 characters or glyphs.
- Text is not justified.
- Paragraph line-height is at least 1.5 the font size.

**üéØ Goal:** Update the page to follow the criterion above.
