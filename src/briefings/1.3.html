<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>"One image is worth a thousand words"</em>, they say.</p>
<p>Images help us to understand better some content. They are especially useful for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>
<p>However, inaccessible images can create major barriers for people with visual disabilities. Accessible images will benefit not only them, but also the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of a website.</p>
<p>We know that every <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> must have an <code>alt</code> attribute. However, it doesn't need to be used equally everywhere.
In the same way, there are <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images">different images concepts</a>, we can also describe them in different ways.
For example, if the image doesn't add any relevant information about the content, we can just leave an empty alt: <code>alt=""</code>.</p>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>In the <a href="../exercises/1.3.html">exercise page</a>,
there are 4 visual representations, but none of them are accessible.</p>
<p><strong>ðŸŽ¯ Goal:</strong> Add the necessary accessible descriptions to each image.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Alt text</strong> - Replace the image <code>src</code> with an invalid URL and see how the browser renders a broken image. Does the alt text makes sense?</p>
<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>
<p>In slow internet connections, images take time to load. Some people even prefer to disable images to save bandwidth data.</p>
<p><strong>ðŸŽ¯ Goal:</strong> Edit the CSS to ensure the page looks good when images don't load.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> In your daily job, take this as an opportunity for developers and designers to collaborate!</p>
