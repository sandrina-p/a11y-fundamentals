# 2.3. Navigation Shortcuts

## Introduction

Let's talk about the websites with a lot of links at the top of the page before the actual main content.

The keyboard-only users are forced to tab through every single link before they can reach the main content. We, as web creators, can make better than that, right?

A common way to bypass this is to create "Skip Navigation Links". The basic concept involves two elements: A _trigger_ and a _target_.

```html
<!-- Trigger: a link pointing to an #id -->
<a href="#main" class="skipLink">Skip to main content</a>

<!-- Target: A part of the page with the same id -->
<!-- Some browsers will only focus if tabindex="-1" is used -->
<main id="main" tabindex="-1">...</main>
```

We can visually hide the skip links by default and only shown them when focused.

```css
.skipLink {
  /* hide visually the link */
  opacity: 0;
  /* make it unreachable by mouse */
  pointer-events: none;
}

.skipLink:focus {
  /* show the link on focus */
  opacity: 1;
}
```

The visual location of the link isn't that important. The goal is to make that link one of the first ones to be accessed.

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/2.3.html),
let's create some "Skip Navigation" links to jump directly to the main section of the page.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Create navigation shortcuts through the page.
