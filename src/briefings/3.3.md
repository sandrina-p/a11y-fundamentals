# 3.3. Accessible forms

## Introduction

When talking about the accessibility of a form, usually we are talking about their accessibility regarding people who use screen readers or keyboards. However **everyone benefits from a well-organized and usable form**, especially those with cognitive disabilities. Forms should be clear and intuitive.

When building forms, we should make sure that:

- Every form control has a label
- Explicit required form fields
- Explicit formatting requirements
- Forms are keyboard accessible

First things first, a form control must always have a respective label.

```html
<!-- Option A: Use for="" and id="" to connect the label to the input -->
<label for="uName">Name</label>
<input type="text" id="uName" />

<!-- Option B: Wrap the text and the input in a <label>.
  The browser will then link both. -->
<label>
  <span>Name</span>
  <input type="text" />
</label>
```

If we do that with every form element, it's already a step forward! There's a lot more about [creating accessible forms](https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/), that we'll practice today.

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/3.3.html), there are 5 form controls. Each one has a particular accessibility issue.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Make the form accessible for keyboard and screen readers.

**Hint 1:** SR users usually fill forms using `Tab` key only. Do the same to detect A11Y issues.

**Hint 2:** Use the Accessibility Tree tab on DevTools, to know how a form control is announced.

## Bonus

### #1 ARIA Live regions

When submitting the form, a feedback message is displayed, based on the submission result (success or invalid).

While these changes are visually apparent to users who can see the page,
they aren't obvious to screen reader users.

ARIA live regions fill this gap helping to expose this dynamic content.

```html
<!-- The content is announce immediately when added to the DOM.
Use it when it's critical information.  -->
<div aria-live="assertive">The form you tried to submit is invalid.</div>

<!-- The content is announced when there's a change (idle).
Use it when this do not influence the user main task.  -->
<div aria-live="polite">Playing now: "Pink Floyd - Time"</div>
```

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Explicit mark the form feedback messages as dynamic content.

Here's a [codepen example](https://codepen.io/vloux/details/jxPrWy) exploring multiple ways of using `aria-live`. In this exercise the code is ready to follow the approach #3.

### #2 Using buttons inside forms

_This is already done, but let me explain this common form mistake:_

1. Go to the exercise page, to both `<button>` elements and remove `type` attribute.

This creates 2 bugs:

- Press the password's visibility button (by mouse or keyboard). The form is also submitted (check the logs in the console).
- Press "Enter" in any input, the password is also toggled.

**Why does that happen?**

The default type of a `<button>` is `"submit"`.
When a button inside a `<form>` is clicked, the form will look for the first "submit" button and trigger it.
In this form, the first button is the password toggle. That's why when we click it, it submits the form too.

**Takeaway:** Always explicit the button type (`type="button"` or `type="submit"`) when used inside forms to avoid unwanted form submissions.
