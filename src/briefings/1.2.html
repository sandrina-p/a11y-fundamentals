<h1 id="12semantichtml">1.2 Semantic HTML</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Web standards are rules and guidelines used to promote code consistency when building a web page. With those, anyone (people and robots) can access and understand the content of a webpage in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>One of the Web standards consists in writing semantic HTML markup: Go beyond <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> (non-semantic elements) and replace them by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">semantic elements</a>. Use them where it makes sense: to describe sections, text, media, and so on. This way, we are not only writing <strong>readable code</strong>, but we are also making the web a more <strong>accessible place</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>In the <a href="../exercises/1.2.html">exercise page</a>,
there's a layout implemented that follows appearance guidelines.
However, under the hood, if we see the page naked (without CSS styles), it doesn't make much sense.
People who read this page through an Assistive Technology (AT), for example, a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Screen_reader">screen reader</a>, will struggle to understand it properly.</p>
<p><strong>ðŸŽ¯ Goal:</strong> Improve the HTML by using semantic elements.</p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> You can start by removing the styles and try to read the page as if it was a book: plain old text. Improve the HTML until this book makes sense to you.</p>
<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>
<h3 id="1orderofcontent">1. Order of content</h3>
<p>In a book, the title is always the first thing to show up. However, on this page, the tag "On Sale" appears before the title.</p>
<p><strong>ðŸŽ¯ Goal:</strong> <em>reorder the HTML elements</em> so that the title and the tag appear in the correct order, but without changing the design!</p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Perhaps some flexbox trick can help us to <em>reverse</em> the <em>order</em> visually.</p>
<h3 id="2missingcontent">2. Missing content</h3>
<p>We can visually understand that the plant is on sale ($40 to $30). However, if we see the page naked (without styles), it doesn't make much sense. We see two price tags, but we don't know the difference between them. Some people may not even understand that's the plant price.</p>
<p><strong>ðŸŽ¯ Goal:</strong> Add the missing words to be visible when the page is displayed without styles.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Price:&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> What CSS will you use at <code>.visually-hidden</code>? There are <a href="https://a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-hide-content/">better ways to hide content</a> than using <code>display: none;</code>.</p>

<li><strong>Did you know?</strong> There's a global <a href="https://css-naked-day.github.io/">CSS naked day</a> on April 9. The idea behind it is to promote Web Standards. In this day, developers release their websites without styles, showing only the plain old text with HTML.</li>
