# 1.1 Appearance

## Introduction

Accessibility is not just about making information available to people with disabilities.
It's also about respecting people's preferences, including appearance preferences.
Three common appearance preferences are _color_, _motion_ and _size_.

### Color preference

Any person, with or without disabilities must be able to perceive content with ease. [WebAIM contract checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), [Colorable](https://colorable.jxnblk.com/001b66/00ffa2) and [Stark](https://www.getstark.co/) are just three of the many free tools available to help us follow the [WCAG color contrast guidelines](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/).

In case we create multiple themes, we can use the CSS media query [`prefers-color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) that allows us to set the default theme based on the user color preferences.

```css
body {
  background: white;
  color: black;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background: black;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

### Motion preference

Modern websites tend to use motion techniques as a way to communicate information. However, some people find them distracting or uncomfortable and others can't perceive the animations at all, particularrly people with cognitive disabilities or slow devices owners.

In spite of the growing desire to create an immersive experience, we must not forget that **animations are an enhancement** and should not be a barrier to understand the content.

The CSS media query `preferes-reduced-motion` allows us to respect the user's motion preferences.

```css
.error {
  animation: shake 400ms;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .error {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```

### Size Preference

Websites should adapt their content size based on the user's preferences. This can be achieved by using relative sizes instead of absolute sizes.

The relative units `rem` and `em` are the best replacments for `px`. An `em` is an unit of typography, relative to the font-size of its nearest parent. `rem` is only relative to the html (root) `font-size`.

The default `font-size` in almost every browser is `16px`. Assuming that, we can say that **`1rem = 16px`**.

The math is `x/16` where `x` is the pixel value. ex: `24px/16 = 1.5rem`

```css
.heading-1 {
  font-size: 1.75rem; /* same as 28px (28/16) */
}
```

## Exercise

Let's wrap up all the 3 appearance preferences in 3 quick exercises.
In the [exercise page](../exercises/1.2.html), there are 3 accessibility problems:

- Color: The label "New In" and the button "Add to favorites" are not accessible.
- Motion: The icon "Notifications" has a constant shaky animation.
- Size: The page is written with absolute units.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Make the page follow appearance guidelines.

- **Hint 1:** Use the DevTools color picker to detect contrast issues.
- **Hint 2:** Customize your browser font size to see how the page reacts as you update the code from absolute to relative units. Go to _Settings > Appearance > Font Size_. (Chrome and Firefox)

## Bonus

### #1 Easier ratio: 1rem = 10px

Doing the math `x/16` can be painful when dealing with certain numbers such as 15px (0.9375rem). You may wonder: _Why can't 1rem equal 10px?_ Well, there's a way! Let's set the HTML (root) font-size to 62.5%. It works because 62.5% of 16px is 10px. Now you can do the direct math `1rem === 10px`.

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}

body {
  font-size: 1.6rem; /* 16px */
}

.heading-1 {
  /* font-size: 28px; */ /* -- old way */
  font-size: 2.8rem; /* ------ new way */
}
```
